Nymea software and libraries are provided under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs and VARs) and open source projects.
This allows different models to utilise the software stack:

## Under Open-Source license

We are dedicated to open-source and free software, that's why we open-source'd nymea:core, nymea:app and a number of nymea Plug-ins and other tools.

Nymea is licensed under “GPLv3”. You can use nymea for free as long as your application is compliant to GPLv3.
Nymea Plug-ins are typically published under the LGPLv3. Please verify the license of each Plug-in in the license header of the respective source files: http://www.github.com/nymea/nymea-plugins

More about the GPLv3 and LGPLv3 here: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html

If you consider to create commercial products based on open-source licenses, we advise to check for any legal implications.

## Commercial license
With the commercial license you can combine and distribute your software with nymea for any commercial purpose. You don’t have to comply with the rules of the open-source license.

The nymea commercial license comes with additional tools and services to make a developers
life easier. You can download the terms and condition [here](https://nymea.io/legal/GTC.pdf).

You can utilise most of the building blocks of the nymea ecosystem in a commercial product:
 - [nymea:core](https://nymea.io/documentation/users/installation/core) (the middleware), including most of the nymea integration plugins
 - [nymea:app](https://nymea.io/documentation/users/installation/app) (cross-platform user interface)
 - [nymea-mqtt](https://github.com/nymea/nymea-mqtt) (standalone MQTT broker)
 - [BerryLan](https://github.com/nymea/berrylan) (easy WiFi setup for Raspberry) which is actually driven by
 - [nymea-networkmanager](https://github.com/nymea/nymea-networkmanager)


If you think on building a commercial product you have two options:

### Closed binaries (ready-to-use software)
You purchase closed binaries and install/ship ready-to-use software within your product.

### SDK (build upon nymea)
You purchase the nymea developer license, and make use of the nymea source code however you want it. You don't need to comply to GPLv3. Since nymea is based on the Qt, this also requires you to have a valid Qt license.
