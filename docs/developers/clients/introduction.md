## Introduction

There are different options for creating clients for nymea.


### JSONRPC API

The first option is to access the raw JSONRPC API. This is the main way of interacting with nymea from a 
client perspective. Please refer to the [RAW JSONRPC API](raw-api) documentation for a detailed documentation
on all the available methods.

### C++/Qt/QML

If writing a C++ or Qt/QML client application, nymea:app's internal library can be used to have a complete
wrapper of the JSONRPC API. Please refer to the [nymea:app library](nymea-app-lib) documentation for 
instructions on how to get started.

### Python

For python developers there is nymea-cli providing examples how to interact with nymea. Please refer to 
the [nymea:cli documentation](nymea-cli-dev).
