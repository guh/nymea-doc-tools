## Interfaces

Advantages of interfaces:
* Propper appearance in the App
* Interface based rules, e.g. shut of all lights.
* Rule templates
* Device categories can be mapped to HomeKit, Alexa Smart Home Skills, etc

A Interface requires certain states, actions and events. Those are the minimum requirements, the device can 
be extended with additional states, actions and events. The first interface defined is the main interface.


The nymea:app displays the device with it's main interface. Additional states, actions and events are available
in the details view.
