A nymea installation requires 2 parts. The first step is to install nymea:core on a machine and the second step is to install
a cliean application, typically nymea:app or nymea-cli on the machines that are used to control nymea:core. This can be all on the
same host or distributed across multiple devices.

A typical nymea setup will have nymea:core running on a low power host, such as a Raspberry Pi which is connected to the local network
and a multitude of client installations on various other devices. For example every member of the network having nymea:app on their mobile
phone, PCs etc.
