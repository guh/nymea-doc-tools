nymea software and libraries are provided under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs and VARs) and open source projects.

## Commercial license


With the commercial license you can combine and distribute your software with nymea for any commercial purpose. You don’t have to comply with the rules of the open-source license.

Please keep in mind, that nymea is based on the Qt framework and thus requires a valid Qt license.

The nymea commercial license comes with additional tools and services to make a developers
life easier. You can download the terms and condition [here](https://nymea.io/license).
 

## Open-Source License

We are dedicated to open-source and free software, that's why we open-source'd nymea:core, nymea:app and a number of nymea Plug-ins and other tools.

nymea is licensed under “GPLv3”. You can use nymea for free as long as your application is compliant to GPLv3.

nymea Plug-ins are typically published under the LGPLv3. Please verify the license of each Plug-in in the license header of the respective source files: http://www.github.com/nymea/nymea-plugins

More about the GPLv3 and LGPLv3 here: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html

If you consider to create commercial products based on open-source licenses, we advise to check for any legal implications.
