First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. We are happy that you are interested in contributing
to nymea!


## Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to nymea. You don't need to be a developer in order to contribute! This
page will outline some options if you'd like to support us.



### Translations
Translations are an easy way for anyone to contribute. nymea uses weblate to get translations done. If
you'd like to translate nymea to your language, or fix a typo, head over to https://translate.nymea.io/
and sign up for an account. One of the admins will activate your account soon and you're ready to go. Ideally
you join our telegram and let us know about it but that's not required.


### Testing/Bug reporting
Like any other software project, bugs happen. In order to strive for the best possible quality, we're
thankful for everyone reporting bugs. If you've found a bug, please let us know by reporting it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/nymea). If you are unsure whether you've found a bug, don't hesitate to join
the [nymea forum](https://forum.nymea.io) and discuss your issue with us and other users.


### Make some noise!
Another very much important thing that any project requires is users, as many of them as possible. The 
larger our community grows, the faster progress there will be. You can help by spreading the word about 
nymea. Blogging about it, creating cool youtube videos or simply telling your friends about it and helping 
them setting things up is as valuable as any other contribution.

### Help other users
One more way that makes for an easy start is to help other users. Join the [nymea forum](https://forum.nymea.io)
to answer questions of other users or write howto's, shoot youtube video tutorials or help with creating
other resources that other users might find useful.


### Provide access to new/unsupported hardware
We're always looking to add support for more devices to nymea. If you have a device which isn't supported
yet but would like to see it happen, you can provide us access to it so we can work on supporting it. If 
that's not possible, depending on the complexity of the device, sometimes it's enough to provide us the 
logs we need to get going. Check out the forum and head to the hardware section. Let us know about your 
device and we'll see how to get going with it.


###  Code contributions
nymea is developed on GitHub. For code contributions, please file a pull request as usual there. 

Please understand that in order to accept your contribution, we’re legally required to have a signed 
agreement with everyone who puts effort in the development. It’s the easiest way for you to give us permission 
to use your contributions. Technically, with this agreement, you’re giving us a licence, but you still own 
the copyright — so you still have the right to reiuse your code for any other purpose you want.


All nymea code repositories can be found on [github](https://github.com/nymea).
