[This Hackster article](https://www.hackster.io/michael_zanetti/open-source-smart-home-with-touchscreen-control-panel-55e613) shows how to run nymea:core and nymea:app on a Raspberry Pi with 7" Touch screen panel to control a smart home. This setup features Philips Hue lights, homebrew RGB LED stripes using boblight, FlowerCare sensors to monitor plants, integrate with Kodi and Sonoff light switches.

Building a hot tub yourself? No prob with nymea, as shown in [this Hackster article](https://www.hackster.io/124582/open-source-hot-tub-controller-e0a1f3). An old very unsmart hot tub has been supplied with a Raspberry Pi with nymea on it and turned into a fully smart hot tub. It can be turned on remotely on the way home from the office and sends out push notifications when the water has reached the comfort temperature.

Nymea is used to build a DIY sensor station as described in [this Hackster article](https://www.hackster.io/simonstuerz/smart-and-private-open-source-sensor-station-c45788). The article shows how to integrate digital and analog sensors to your nymea  system and let the environment react based on the measurements. The big difference to existing products is the privacy of the data and the functionallity even without internet connectivity.

Nymea is helping the Raspberry Pi community to get set up without cable and terminal with [BerryLan](https://berrylan.app). Ever prepared a Raspberry Pi for a non-technical friend? It can be a real challenge to configure WiFi in the destination network if your friendly linux guru from the hood isn't around. BerryLan helps with that, adding cable and terminal free wifi setup to the Raspberry Pi, straight there on your smartphone display.
